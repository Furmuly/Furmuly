### Hi there 👋
⬅️ As you can see right here my name is Nabila, I am a young IT developer who has stepped into the world of coding not long ago. I am doing an apprenticeship at JobTrek and I am now in my second year of IT application development. I love discovering and learning new concepts and I also have a passion for coding languages. My main objective is to get better every day at what I do and love.
